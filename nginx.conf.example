# Nginx configuration for PP Backend
# This file demonstrates how to configure nginx to handle large file uploads
# Copy this to your server's nginx configuration location (usually /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-site)

# If you're using nginx as a reverse proxy, add these directives to your server block:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;  # Replace with your domain

    # Increase the maximum allowed size of the client request body
    # This is the KEY setting that fixes the 413 error
    client_max_body_size 10M;

    # Optional: Increase timeouts for large uploads
    client_body_timeout 300s;
    client_header_timeout 300s;

    # Optional: Increase buffer sizes
    client_body_buffer_size 128k;

    # Proxy settings for your Express app
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;  # Replace with your backend port
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;

        # Important: Increase timeouts for file uploads
        proxy_read_timeout 300s;
        proxy_connect_timeout 300s;
        proxy_send_timeout 300s;
    }
}

# If you have SSL/HTTPS, add this in your HTTPS server block as well:
# server {
#     listen 443 ssl;
#     server_name your-domain.com;
#     
#     # SSL configuration here...
#     
#     client_max_body_size 10M;  # Same setting for HTTPS
#     client_body_timeout 300s;
#     
#     location / {
#         proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
#         # ... same proxy settings as above
#     }
# }
